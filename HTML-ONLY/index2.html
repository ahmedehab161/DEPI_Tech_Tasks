        I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript and web development.<br>

        I have been developing web applications since 1995. In 1999, I was a technical manager at a German Internet startup that later expanded internationally. In 2006, I held my first talk on Ajax. In 2010, I received a Ph.D. in Informatics from the University of Munich.<br>

        Since 2011, I have been blogging at 2ality and written several books on JavaScript and TypeScript. I also hold talks and trainings about web development.<br>

        I live in Munich, Germany, and speak German, English, French, and Spanish. My pronouns are he/him.
